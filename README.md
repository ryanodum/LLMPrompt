Select files from a directory, and LLMPrompt will take the UTF-8 encoded text from each selected file, and concatenate the text with any MetaPrompts, Instructions, or Non-Standard/unique prompts added by the user in the provided text field.

When the selections have been made, and any user text has been added, clicking the "Build and Copy Prompt" button will copy the fully preprocessed prompt to the clipboard, for use in a LLM.
