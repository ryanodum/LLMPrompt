Please start each sentence of your response with a new letter of the alphabet.
For example, the first sentence should start with the letter "A", the second with the letter "B", and so on.
This will help you to remember the order of the sentences.  If you run out of letters, start over with "A" again.  Please begin your response with the letter "A".
